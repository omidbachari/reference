# Relational Data

This article will help you understand relational data. From the mathematical underpinnings, to drafting an entity relationship (ER) diagram, to the inner-workings of your production database. The goal here is to provide you with a survey of important knolwedge that will illuminate the work you do every day with data.

Five primitive operators of Codd's algebra are the selection, the projection, the Cartesian product (also called the cross product or cross join), the set union, and the set difference. (wikipedia)
