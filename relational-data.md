# Relational Data

This article will help you understand relational data modeling. From the mathematical underpinnings, to drafting an entity relationship (ER) diagram, the goal here is to provide you with a survey of important knolwedge that will illuminate the work you do every day with data.

In addition, being familiar with the terminology and background of relational data modeling can make you a stronger job candidate, as hiring managers appreciate someone who has taken the time to understand the "Why?" behind our every day technology.

## What is data?

Data generally

data

data element

thinking behind data management - (pg 4 of relational data modeling)

## What is a data model?

conceptual, logical, physical data models

as-is vs to-be

data element cycle

why create a model - (pg 13)

## Why relational data modeling?

Heirarchy, network, relational

properties of relational databases - (pg 30)

primary key, foreign key, migrating

objectives (pg 35) and advantages (pg 39) of relational data modeling

selected rules of the 12 rules of relational data management - (pg 36 - 39)

## How does it work mathematically?

requires some basic knowledge of set notation

watershed article - E.F. Codd's relational model of data in 1970 while at IBM

Five primitive operators of Codd's algebra are:
+ the selection
+ the projection
+ the Cartesian product (also called the cross product or cross join)
+ the set union
+ the set difference

renames

joins of all kinds

## How does it work for the rest of us?

normalization

entities

attributes

normal forms - (pg 40-53)

universal relations - (pg 41, 43)
