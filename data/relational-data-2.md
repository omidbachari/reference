## How does it work? Math!

requires some basic knowledge of set notation

watershed article - E.F. Codd's relational model of data in 1970 while at IBM

Five primitive operators of Codd's algebra are:
+ the selection
+ the projection
+ the Cartesian product (also called the cross product or cross join)
+ the set union
+ the set difference

Joins
+ Natural join (⋈)
+ θ-join and equijoin
+ Semijoin (⋉)(⋊)
+ Antijoin (▷)
+ Division (÷)

More joins
+ Outer joins
+ Left outer join (⟕)
+ Right outer join (⟖)
+ Full outer join (⟗)
