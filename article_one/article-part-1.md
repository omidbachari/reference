# Ready. Set. Go!

*A short essay on what you're going to get out of this.**

By Omid Bachari

Welcome! You are about to start a fun journey into programming. And every journey begins with one step. This chapter is all about that first step. Here, we will discuss some important preliminary matters, and take a first dive into the basics of programming.

## Why you are here

First, you are here. We know that. And you're here to discover more about a discipline of engineering called Programming. But let's talk about what brought you here. There are so many possibilities but here is what's common. **You are ready to have fun with your brain**. Programming for fun is a common sentiment, because it's a special way to have fun. Sure, from your brain's perspective, programming may feel like playing Sudoku, a crossword or Solitare. They're all enhanced with coffee. They provide for some bragging rights. But programming doesn't get rolled up with the grocery store coupons and recycled, when you finish.  

### Time well spent

**Instead, programming is a way to sharpen your brain that is professionally and technically significant.** And that's pretty awesome. Because we can't just engineer the plans for a bridge, an deep water oil well, a circuit board, or a bionic arm, just because we feel like it. But we CAN engineer software whenever and wherever we want. And you can, too! How many professional pursuits allow you to do that? That makes programming a killer hobby. It's time well spent.

### Tricks are for the circus, not your career

Sure, that fires you up. But there are some who aren't just here for a super sweet hobby. If you are here because you want to figure out a new career, then we have even better news for you. This guided journey has stops planned at all the right destinations.

Everybody teaching programming tells you what variables are, what a conditional does, etc. Sure, we do, too. But those are just tricks. We are yet to meet someone who identified what a variable is, slapped it on a resume and then got hired. It does not happen. People don't get hired for learning how to do tricks. This journey is about fundamentally changing how you think and improving who you are. **This is about turning you into an engineer.** Engineers solve problems. Engineers collaborate at a high level. Engineers get hired.

## "The thing is, I'm stupid. Does that change things?"

You may believe a myth: you can't do this. That's something we need to knock out right now. Programming looks daunting. But that's because you haven't done it before. Intimidation at this point is normal, but keep it in context.

Everything requires some training and can intimidate the uninitiated. Take your current full-time job or your favorite hobby. Someone trying to step into your shoes with only an instant to prepare might make some mistakes and get confused. This is no exception. Give us a chance to teach you some basics and give yourself a chance to be a beginner.

Programming is a field where the learning is constant. That's what makes it fulfilling. But that means you're going to see something new and strange almost every day. So, it's time for our first stop for becoming an engineer.

## Lesson 1: See something new? FREAK THE FUCK OUT!

Just kidding. Part of being a great programmer is being aware of the discomfort that attends strange and unknown intellectual territory, without letting it cause paralysis.

Here is the lesson. **Something new is always awaiting your discovery.** A new programming language, a new lesson, a new algorithm, a new error message or a new way of thinking. So, what do you do when you see something new? Try thinking through these steps, as a beginner:

1. I just discovered something unfamiliar.
2. There might be something here that challenges me.
3. I have survived new challenges before, whether in programming or life.
4. There is a solution to this problem. I just have to find it.
5. I'm going to break this down.
6. I'm not going to let this stop me.
7. I'm going to be proud when I solve this.

If you do this long enough, some of those thoughts will become second nature. However, what distinguishes a great programmer is this intellectual bravery. It's an attitude of "I can handle anything." The fact is, we can't handle any problem. And we need to be honest when we're stuck. But the positive attitude and the willingness to try are what will make you. Paralysis and fear will break you.

Does that sound like a lesson you can learn while playing Sudoku? Didn't think so. Is that going to make you a kick ass person? Absolutely. Is it also going to make you a better programming? You better fucking believe it.

## Good luck!

We have looked at why you are here, and what you can hope to gain on this journey. We also learned our first lesson. The next step is to dive in.
